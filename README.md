# Task Manager App üìù

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.1.

This project uses the Angular Material style library for the use of components .

This project uses lazyloading routing for lazy loading of modules in order to call the specific route that is being used.

This project has an architecture where everything related to Task is within itself, the shared components and services are within shared and commonly used files are within common.

It was decided to use a minimalist design with only black and white colors where it would be pleasant for the human eye to be able to see, create, update and delete its tasks.
